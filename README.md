# Dark Mode Feature

This React application includes a **Dark Mode** feature to enhance user experience. Users can toggle between **light** and **dark** themes for improved visibility and comfort in different lighting conditions. The implementation leverages React state management for dynamic theme switching and applies styles conditionally based on the selected mode.

## Key Features:
- **Smooth theme transitions** for a seamless user experience.
- **Persistent theme preference** using local storage.
- **Fully responsive design**, supporting both light and dark modes across different devices.
